# Menu Archive
Menu 1 through 7, in pascal ABC, executables available.

--------------------------------------------------------------
> Why here?
It's here as an archival copy of my old Menu project, my first project ever.

>  Why aren't most of the programs here executable?

Well, most of them simply don't work, and never did (that's why there is a lot of versions here)

> Will you add or fix functions or programs in this repo?

I will fix only the MenuV7, because I clearly remember that it worked, and had (very basic) graphics.

>Will you add some other programs to this repo?

No, this repo is for Menu programs only.
